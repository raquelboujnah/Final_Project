Creating an app for people who think about getting a dog for the first time. the app will simulate a month as a dog owner (without a dog)

The owner will have: 
- a wallet budjet to buy food, get the dog to the veterinar, fix some damage in his house, maybe for dogsiting
- a reminder for going for an hour walk byhimself, to a dogpark
- a reminder for feeding the dog
- a small courses to train a dog and a reminder for an hour to simulate that
- a list of things they will need to do or buy before the dog's arrival
- a fun fact message every day about dogs
- Choosing different breeds of dogs, each with unique needs and expenses.
- Unexpected events (e.g., vet emergencies, training issues) to simulate real-life challenges.
- Tracks the user's performance over time, giving feedback on whether they are ready for dog ownership.
- Community Integration: Add a social aspect where users can share their experiences and tips with others.

        This outline should help guide the development process for your dog ownership simulation app!




1. Choosing Different Breeds of Dogs
    Step 1: Research Dog Breeds
        Create a database of different dog breeds with associated data like typical size, temperament, daily exercise needs, common health issues, and average costs (food, grooming, vet visits).
    
    Step 2: Breed Selection UI
        In your frontend, build a selection screen where users can choose from a list of dog breeds. Use dropdowns or cards with images and basic information.
    
    Step 3: Breed-Specific Needs and Expenses
        Adjust the wallet budget and reminders based on the breed selected. For instance, a large breed might require more food and have higher vet costs.
    
    Step 4: Database Integration
        Store user-selected breeds in your database and link them to user accounts. Use this information to personalize the experience.


2. Unexpected Events
    Step 1: Create Event Scenarios
        Define a set of possible unexpected events (e.g., emergency vet visits, dog damages furniture, training issues). Assign probabilities and impacts (costs, time, etc.) to each event.

    Step 2: Event Triggers
        Implement logic in your backend to randomly trigger these events. This could be done at random intervals or based on user actions.

    Step 3: User Notifications
        Build a notification system to inform users about the events. Include options for users to react (e.g., pay for the vet visit, repair damages).

    Step 4: Impact Calculation
        Adjust the wallet budget and time reminders based on the userâ€™s reaction to these events. Track how they handle these challenges.


3. Performance Tracking and Feedback
    Step 1: Define Performance Metrics
        Establish key metrics like how well the user manages the budget, how consistently they follow reminders, and how they handle unexpected events.
    
    Step 2: Tracking System
        Use Redux to manage state related to user actions and decisions. Track performance data across the month.
    
    Step 3: Feedback Mechanism
        At the end of the simulation, generate a report for the user that evaluates their readiness for dog ownership. Highlight areas of strength and improvement.

    Step 4: Data Visualization
        Implement charts or graphs to visually represent the user's performance over time. Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for this.


4. Community Integration
    Step 1: Social Feature Planning
        Plan out what kind of community features you want. This could include a forum, comment sections on dog breed pages, or a tips section.

    Step 2: Backend Integration
        Set up a database for storing user posts, comments, and interactions. Implement RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on posts and comments.

    Step 3: UI/UX Design
        Design a user-friendly interface for community interaction. Include features like upvoting, sharing tips, and following other users.

    Step 4: Moderation Tools
        Implement tools for moderating content, such as flagging inappropriate posts or comments. You might also want to integrate a simple reputation system.

    Step 5: Real-Time Features
        Consider adding real-time capabilities like live chat or instant notifications for community interactions using WebSockets or services like Firebase.
